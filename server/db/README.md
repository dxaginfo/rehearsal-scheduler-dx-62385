# Database

This directory contains all database-related files, including:

- `migrations/`: SQL migration files for database schema changes
- `seeds/`: Seed data for development and testing

## Migrations

Migrations are versioned SQL files that define and update the database schema. They are executed in order based on their prefix number (e.g., 001, 002, etc.).

## Seeds

Seeds are used to populate the database with initial data for development and testing purposes.
